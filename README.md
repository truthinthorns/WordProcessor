# WordProcessor

This was an end-of-semester project that was to be written in Java. It was supposed to be a word processor that is similar to Notepad. This one was interesting to write. May redo it some day as the code is very ugly and very long. I don't believe we could use NetBeans' visual interface to create the UI. Or, it wasn't available in the version of NetBeans I used. Maybe both.
